I had a chance to interview at Atlan for frontend engineer intern. I must say that this was the smoothest interview process I have involved into so far. During the process, I had another offer and I discuss and requested the HR to expedite the process.

## Applying

I reached out to the senior recruiter via cold email, attached my resume and profile I am interested in working at Atlan.

Within a day, I received a reply “We are very excited to take your application forward. As the next steps, we’d like to schedule a quick 15 to 20-minute phone call to know you better.” from recruiter.

## First Call

The first call is basically a telephonic round with HR. We discuss about the role, company, my availability and further process.

After this call, I was about to receive a challenge as a take home assignment.

## The Challenge

The assignment comprised of a notion link describing the project overview, what to be done, what not to worry about.

As the position I applied was frontend role, I received the challenge purely based on building the frontend web application.

The submission requires a GitHub repo. The GitHub repo needs to consist the readme describing the problem and the solution, setup guide, performance analytics and tech stack used.

The challenge deadline was 7 days, I submitted the challenge in the 2nd day along with documentation.

I submitted the challenge on friday, I receive an update on monday, saying “We liked your solution”. After that, I had my technical interview next day(Tuesday).

## Technical Interview

It was an hour long interview with the engineering director at Atlan. He made me comfortable and we had a great chat around the assignment.

We started with discussion about Atlan, what problem Atlan is trying to solve, what do we do.

After that I was about to demonstrate my solution(web-app) sharing my screen. We majorly discuss the edge cases, performance optimization, and what could I have done better.

We also discuss regarding my familiarity with different tech stack and new technologies.

I had no idea where the hour flies, and we ended the call.

I was nervous as I could have done better in some optimization questions which I realized afterwards.

## The Next Day(Offer Day)

I had interview on tuesday, it was wednesday(28th June). As I mention above, I had another offer from Fi(frontend intern), and need to join on 3rd July(onsite). It was risky moment as on wednesday I need to accept and arrange for my accomadations for fi and still I remain with cultural round at Atlan.

I was more inclined to Atlan.

I was about to send my acceptance to fi as I have not received update from Atlan, but just then I received call from HR that I cleared the technical interview and I had an offer. Luckily, I had no cultural round.

I thank HR for being so generous and supportive throughout the process.

## Conclusion

I had many rejections before the offer, more than 100 in span of a month. But each rejection, interview rejection led me to this final interview at Atlan. I must say that if I don’t have faced the rejection I could not have cleared the Atlan, even the challenge.

At each rejection, I introspected myself and learned the thing in which I lagged. Offcourse, it was hard to receive rejections on rejections. But I am so grateful to have these rejections that made me strong and was able to clear the Atlan.

Today I am starting my 2nd week at Atlan. And I had wonderful time on my first week at Atlan.

Would like to thank my family and my friend Yashika Jotwani.
