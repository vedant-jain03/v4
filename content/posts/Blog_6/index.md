## What is HackWithInfy?
HackWithInfy is a competitive coding competition for second-year to pre-final year students across India. In this competition, participants have to solve coding questions in a given time and top performers get a chance to interview Infosys.
The level of the competition was medium-hard. I solved 1 question and got AC and other 2 partially accepted. I did not remember the exact questions but they were mainly based on Arrays, Greedy and DP. 

> All questions can be solved partially with brute force, so will recommend you to solve every question.

If you solved 1 questions fully and some testcases for other 2, you will definitely going to get the interview for DSE role.
So there were two roles Infosys was offering:
- SE : 9 LPA
- DSE : 6.25 LPA

If you are able to solve all 3, you will get upgraded to advanced rounds and will surely get the interview for SE.

## Interview Experience

I got the mail on 3 May 2022 to schedule my interview and I scheduled nearest date possible 7th May. My interviewer forgot about the interview and hence he slept and get back to me after 2 hours. That was funny, XD. Never mind. 
The interviewer was really chilled and cool. 

- He asked me for the introduction.
- Then asked me about my current semester subjects.
- He then started with question to check weather a number is prime or not. I shared my screen and he asked me that, what if in place of `#include <bits/stdc++>` can we write `#include "bits/stdc++.h"`, I was not sure about it and said no it will not compiled but it compiled successfully and then I realised about importing modules in react with "". 
I got pretty nervous.
- He then asked me that main() function will return 0 to whom? In my mind I was right OS, but as my overconfident killed my before I not tell him the answer.
- Then I write the code, he gave me sample TC and it ran fine.
- He then asked me the topic which I can not expect, **What is DFA**, I asked him to repeat I heard DFS, but it was Deterministic Finite Automata. Luckily I learned the topic in my online classes(YES, I attended first class) and told him everything I knew.
- He then asked me about my projects.
- He then started with some sense of humour question
  - What is color of the wall behind you?
  - What is the color of your Shirt?
  - How many buttons in your T-Shirt?

- He then asked me 
  - What do you know about Infosys?
  - Where do you see yourself after 5 years?

We wrapped up and ask me for any doubts.
- I asked him about his experience.
- I asked him about my feedback. He told me that I have good communication skills and open source experience.

## Conclusion

It is going to be very chill and easy, just be confident(not over).
