- My proposal got accepted by The Palisadoes Organization for the Talawa Project.
- Talawa is a modular open-source project to manage group activities of both non-profit organizations and businesses.
- I am working on improving the developer documentation for Talawa-App(Flutter), Talawa-AP (Node.js and GraphQL), and Talawa-Admin(React.ts).
