So I have made some input fields with default values in component views which are connected to data-controller=projects and in <code class=\"language-text\">projects_controller</code> I have to write code to get the value from those input fields and after the user hits that <code class=\"language-text\">Publish</code> button, the function in controller takes the values from each input and save it to the variable and finally made a <code class=\"language-text\">URL</code> variable along with <code class=\"language-text\">query parameters</code> passed to fetch the values in <code class=\"language-text\">embed.js</code>. The URL looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">const url = `${document.querySelector('#url').value}?theme=${theme}&amp;display_title=${displayTitle}&amp;clock_time=${clockTimeEnable}&amp;fullscreen=${fullscreen}&amp;zoom_in_out=${zoomInOut}`;</code></pre></div>\n<p>and in <code class=\"language-text\">embed.js</code> I accessed those parameters using this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);</code></pre></div>\n<p>and to retrieve certain values I use something like this:\n<code class=\"language-text\">const fullscreen = params.get('fullscreen');</code></p>\n<p>So that was all about this week's work.

There will be the primary mentor(owner) of the group who can add mentors to the group. Mentors can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create and delete assignments</li>\n<li>Grade assignments</li>\n<li>Reopen closed assignments</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The PR was created by Ruturaj(GSoC'22 Mentor, former GSoC Contributor) and most of the work was done by him, the main functionality. The PR was a long time ago and there are many new features in CircuitVerse from that time that were causing conflicts. The PR need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To be updated with the master</li>\n<li>Should contain i18n translation</li>\n<li>Powered with stimulus.js</li>\n<li>Fix Circle CI because of LMS integration that was not implemented at that time.</li>\n<li>UI fix.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I added all the things one by one commit for clean PR but there was always an error from CodeClimate(bot) for clean code. I was able to change some of them. But the important fail was of CI and it was caused because of the lti_spec because at the time this PR was created lti feature was not there in the CircuitVerse and in this PR the <code class=\"language-text\">mentor</code> field is replaced with the <code class=\"language-text\">primary_mentor</code> field in the DB so there was error because of that. I was able to fix it.</p>\n<p>Testing locally using <code class=\"language-text\">bundle exec rspec</code> was not working.

After getting selected, our private channel was created and all the contributors, mentors, and OA were there. We had our first meeting on 26th May, and we were welcomed by our mentors, I meet my mentors Aboobacker, Pavan, Samiran, Ayan, Ruturaj, and contributors Pulkit, Devjit, and Aman. It was a pleasure meeting them all. We had a great meeting and our mentors told us about the flow of the GSoC at CircuitVerse.</p>\n<p>After that, for each project separate private channels were created and I had my meeting with my project’s mentors. We set up the project board on GitHub for tracking the project's progress and discussing the project scope, and deliverables. I asked them to let me start the coding on 1st June, as I was aware of the codebase.</p>\n<h2>My progress and learning (1st June — 10th June)</h2>\n<p>I start with the feature of integrating Gitlab Authentication for CircuitVerse. I used omniauth-gitlab gem for that. I made an application in gitlab for testing and configured the .env file. I configured and implemented all the required things correctly referencing other OAuth implementations but there was an unknown error. I had a meeting with my mentor and the problem was the omniauth gem version. I will be working on updating that in the upcoming week and hopefully will complete my first task of the Project.</p>\n<p>I also started with implementing SSO(Single Sign-On) in CircuitVerse. I used devise_saml_authenticatable gem for it. I created WIP(Work in Progress) PR for that. I was facing an issue on the IDP side. I will be completing this PR after gitlab-implementation. I am researching it meanwhile…</p>\n<h3>Work done so far</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/3154\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gitlab integration</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/3167\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SSO integration</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I feel the best experience of my engineering life as it is my first work experience. The whole vibe of the community is so supportive. I learned a lot. I don’t know after getting selected for GSoC I feel responsible and am working accordingly. I am researching more, reading more, and learning more. It is the vibe of GSoC.

But I will prefer to choose only 1. I mean you can explore many organizations but start contributing to 1 only.</p>\n<p>You should first choose the organization on the basis of your interest. In my case, I was searching for organizations based on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>web Development</li>\n<li>Javascript technology</li>\n<li>Past GSoC project</li>\n<li>Supportive community</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If it is taking you 1–2 weeks, trust me it is okay and well worth it. Do not aim for a goal in hurry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>How to start contribution?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to the community channel to interact with members and mentors.</li>\n<li>If you are a beginner, checkout for issue with <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> as a label.</li>\n<li>If it is taking time to get your first PR pulled and merge, don't worry, my first PR is not even merged yet, the rule is never stopped.</li>\n<li>Go for the comparatively higher issue next time. Higher issue does not mean with the number of codes, I mean complexity.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Important points regarding contributions?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Quantity never matters, Quality matters. One of the contributors with more PRs than me did not get selected.</li>\n<li>Your learning curve in the community should be exponential.</li>\n<li>Try to review PRs as well, which can improve your understanding. I always try to read the PRs of other contributors and past GSoC fellows, it clears my thoughts and knowledge by getting to know other's approaches.</li>\n<li>Try to participate or attend community meetings and threads!</li>\n<li>Don't raise an issue for anything you see in the deployment, sometime it is expected, so always try to raise a thread in the community, after getting approval there, raise an issue in Github.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>My journey</h2>\n<p>I got to know about CircuitVerse organization through an open-source event in July 2021, I participated in that and won 100$ gift vouchers as well. My first contribution, <a href=\"https://github.com/CircuitVerse/Blog/pull/88\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">PR</a>, it was just SCSS code. I want to thank Nitin and Shreya Prashad for guiding me.</p>\n<p>And then the Fun Began!!!</p>\n<p>I decided to continue my contributions to CircuitVerse and then I got to know about the CircuitVerse GSoC experience. I reach out to the CircuitVerse fellow GSoCers and trust me they were really supportive and encourage me to contribute. I want to thank Pavan Joshi, Ruturaj Mohite, Manjot, and Ayan Biswas for that, they are my mentors now.</p>\n<p>I was not aware of Ruby on Rails at all at that time. It was my first time contributing to a large codebase, so it took me around 15 days to set up CircuitVerse Main Platform.\nI got my first <code class=\"language-text\">good first issue</code> in CircuitVerse, <a href=\"https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/2360\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">PR</a>.</p>\n<p>Then I started learning Ruby on Rails. Learning while implementing it into a large codebase is the best way to understand, trust me. Then I contributed my first Rails code-based PR and got merged. I got inspired by Aboobacker(Org Admin &#x26; my mentor) and Satvik Ramaprasad(Founder). It gave me more confidence. I always try to challenge myself 1 step ahead of issues.</p>\n<p>On November 28th, 2021, the organization admin invited me to join the GitHub community as a member for my consistent contributions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Honestly, I was not aiming CircuitVerse for GSoC only but for the experience and for the open-source. I am always enthusiastic to solve the issues, participate in community meetings, and review others' PR. I got very comfortable with the CircuitVerse environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I try to contribute to other repo as well as CircuitVerse.\nCheckout My All contributions <a href=\"https://github.com/pulls?page=1&#x26;q=is%3Apr+author%3Avedant-jain03+archived%3Afalse+user%3ACircuitVerse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.\nThe organization announces its expected Projects on the wiki before the official GSoC site to get the maximum time to draft the proposal.</p>\n<h3>My project selection!</h3>\n<p>I selected Project 2: CircuitVerse Platform Improvements, I selected the project because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I had major contributions on the main platform only, so I was very comfortable with the whole platform codebase.</li>\n<li>Tech stack required.</li>\n<li>Scope and need.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Proposal Drafting</h3>\n<p>A proposal plays a very vital role in selection especially when there is more than 1 approaching active contributor.\non 7th Feb 2022, CircuitVerse announce the Projects on the wiki and 19th April was the deadline. I had enough time to make a good proposal, I never hurried, I planned to review my first draft by 20th March and I did on 23rd March.\nSo, there were mainly 6 features that need to be implemented so I first start with the feature under my understanding.\nI discussed my approach towards each point with mentors which helped me to understand the expectation of the mentors as well. This point is very important as I was taking some of the features differently but they were meant to do something different, this small misconception can result in a bad choice. I never think ashamed while talking to mentors. I always pinged them whenever I need, not necessarily for small issues.</p>\n<p>Finally, I drafted my proposal using the template given by the Organization.</p>\n<p>Timeline is one of the most important judging criteria, so choose or draft the timeline wisely.</p>\n<h4>Key Points</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Take time to research the scope and needs of the Project.</li>\n<li>Ask mentors for any doubts without hesitation.</li>\n<li>Choose the approach wisely, if you are not able to add the final code, you can add pseudo code.</li>\n<li>Draft the timeline section wisely.</li>\n<li>Review your proposal 2, 3 times. I reviewed it 2 times.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Do not stop your contributions after proposal submission, be active in the community.</p>\n<p>I had my interaction interview as well for the GSoC.\nAnd finally…….</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/tji722b22yz3w4ft4zk5.png\" alt=\"Image description\"></p>\n<p>I was so happy, I remember that I shouted out loud for almost 5 minutes saying yes, f***, I did it, ab bol.</p>\n<p>But I had many rejection stories and I never celebrated this thing.</p>\n<p><strong>GSoC is my first ever life achievement that satisfied me.</strong></p>\n<p>There are many fellows who got accepted in their 1st, 2nd, or even 3rd attempt as well.

In this competition, participants have to solve coding questions in a given time and top performers get a chance to interview Infosys.\nThe level of the competition was medium-hard. I solved 1 question and got AC and other 2 partially accepted. I did not remember the exact questions but they were mainly based on Arrays, Greedy and DP.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All questions can be solved partially with brute force, so will recommend you to solve every question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you solved 1 questions fully and some testcases for other 2, you will definitely going to get the interview for DSE role.\nSo there were two roles Infosys was offering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SE : 9 LPA</li>\n<li>DSE : 6.25 LPA</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are able to solve all 3, you will get upgraded to advanced rounds and will surely get the interview for SE.</p>\n<h2>Interview Experience</h2>\n<p>I got the mail on 3 May 2022 to schedule my interview and I scheduled nearest date possible 7th May. My interviewer forgot about the interview and hence he slept and get back to me after 2 hours. That was funny, XD. Never mind.\nThe interviewer was really chilled and cool.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He asked me for the introduction.</li>\n<li>Then asked me about my current semester subjects.</li>\n<li>He then started with question to check weather a number is prime or not. I shared my screen and he asked me that, what if in place of <code class=\"language-text\">#include &lt;bits/stdc++></code> can we write <code class=\"language-text\">#include \"bits/stdc++.h\"</code>, I was not sure about it and said no it will not compiled but it compiled successfully and then I realised about importing modules in react with \"\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I got pretty nervous.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>He then asked me that main() function will return 0 to whom?

Luckily I learned the topic in my online classes(YES, I attended first class) and told him everything I knew.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He then asked me about my projects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He then started with some sense of humour question</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is color of the wall behind you?</li>\n<li>What is the color of your Shirt?</li>\n<li>How many buttons in your T-Shirt?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He then asked me</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What do you know about Infosys?</li>\n<li>Where do you see yourself after 5 years?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We wrapped up and ask me for any doubts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I asked him about his experience.</li>\n<li>I asked him about my feedback.

I don't remember the exact date when I applied. But my overall experience was awesome though got rejected due to rolling criteria.</p>\n<p>The process contain 3 round:</p>\n<h3>First Round (Telephonic Round)</h3>\n<p>HR called me and told me that my resume is shortlisted for this role and they want to interview me. I was glad as this was my first time I am going to give interview for SDE role with good stipend and they were also providing me PPO (Pre Placement Offer) if satisfied with my work.\nHR told me that my first technical interview will be after 5 days and I can expect easy-medium DSA questions and some questions related to Javascript, OOPS.</p>\n<p>I revise my concept, I do leetcode.</p>\n<h3>Second Round (Technical Round)</h3>\n<p>Interviewer was SDE-2 at Lido. He first asked me to introduce myself. Then he ask me question related to javascript. I was able to give answer but I was not confident about it. He asked me the difference between '==' and '==='. I told him that both are conditional operator and '===' is advancement of '==', it was not fully correct. Then he asked me what is reduce function, I told him it is used in array scope. He was satisfied but not fully. He started asking me about OOPS, he asked me difference between private, protected, public.\nThen he request me to share the screen and ask me 2 DSA question.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Next Greater Element</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I started with brute force and show it to him. He asked me to optimize it, I did it using stack data structure.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Based on hash map.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I started with brute force and he asked me to optimize it, I did it and he was satisfied.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After 2 days I got call that I am selected for next round.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Third Interview(Technical Round)</h3>\n<p>Interviewer was VPE at Lido. He started with my introduction, I prepared for DP, graphs and other higher concepts but he deep dive into hashmap, he not ask my to code, he just give me different conditions for mapping. It was pretty tough.</p>\n<p>As it was my first experience, I learned so many things and gain knowledge. Unfortunately, I was not selected as per rolling basis. But it was nice experience and I hope it helps you as well.</p>\n<p>All the Best!!!</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"date":"2022-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","title":"Host static website for free in less than 10 minutes.","tech":null,"github":null,"external":null,"company":null},"html":"<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/9rt0uun4a1v9qvuep3wr.jpg\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<h1>What is github?</h1>\n<p>GitHub, Inc. is a provider of Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git.
