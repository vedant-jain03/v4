Ruturaj(PR author) had coded the API very neatly. After some cleanups, the PR got finally merged. These functionalities are still unreleased in Production but will be released soon.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/q1qvb9zkg8yerahqc4at.png\" alt=\"Image description\"></p>\n<h3>What Else</h3>\n<p>I also worked on one bug issue and made a PR for it, <a href=\"https://github.com/CircuitVerse/CircuitVerse/pull/3232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It was basically the broken pagination in the project comment section.</p>\n<h3>What Next</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>In the weekly project meeting, we concluded that the <code class=\"language-text\">weekly contest</code> feature should be planned very properly as it can bring new creative users to CircuitVerse. So this week I will be working on PoC (Proof of Concept) for the Contest.</li>\n<li>In the coding part, I will be working on my PR <code class=\"language-text\">Assignment Restriction</code> that is now under the scope of my GSoC project.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>By far, this week was also great. Comparatively, I coded less this week and researched more.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"GSoC 2022 CircuitVerse | Week 4 Report","description":"My 4th week report for the Platform Improvement project with CircuitVerse in GSoC 22.","date":"2022-07-10T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/gsoc_week_4_report","tags":["GSoC'22","Internship"]}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1481993802","1994492073","3391063840","604461682"]}
