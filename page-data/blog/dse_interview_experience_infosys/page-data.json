In this competition, participants have to solve coding questions in a given time and top performers get a chance to interview Infosys.\nThe level of the competition was medium-hard. I solved 1 question and got AC and other 2 partially accepted. I did not remember the exact questions but they were mainly based on Arrays, Greedy and DP.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All questions can be solved partially with brute force, so will recommend you to solve every question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you solved 1 questions fully and some testcases for other 2, you will definitely going to get the interview for DSE role.\nSo there were two roles Infosys was offering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SE : 9 LPA</li>\n<li>DSE : 6.25 LPA</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are able to solve all 3, you will get upgraded to advanced rounds and will surely get the interview for SE.</p>\n<h2>Interview Experience</h2>\n<p>I got the mail on 3 May 2022 to schedule my interview and I scheduled nearest date possible 7th May. My interviewer forgot about the interview and hence he slept and get back to me after 2 hours. That was funny, XD. Never mind.\nThe interviewer was really chilled and cool.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>He asked me for the introduction.</li>\n<li>Then asked me about my current semester subjects.</li>\n<li>He then started with question to check weather a number is prime or not. I shared my screen and he asked me that, what if in place of <code class=\"language-text\">#include &lt;bits/stdc++></code> can we write <code class=\"language-text\">#include \"bits/stdc++.h\"</code>, I was not sure about it and said no it will not compiled but it compiled successfully and then I realised about importing modules in react with \"\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I got pretty nervous.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>He then asked me that main() function will return 0 to whom? In my mind I was right OS, but as my overconfident killed my before I not tell him the answer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Then I write the code, he gave me sample TC and it ran fine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He then asked me the topic which I can not expect, <strong>What is DFA</strong>, I asked him to repeat I heard DFS, but it was Deterministic Finite Automata. Luckily I learned the topic in my online classes(YES, I attended first class) and told him everything I knew.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He then asked me about my projects.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He then started with some sense of humour question</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What is color of the wall behind you?</li>\n<li>What is the color of your Shirt?</li>\n<li>How many buttons in your T-Shirt?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He then asked me</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What do you know about Infosys?</li>\n<li>Where do you see yourself after 5 years?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We wrapped up and ask me for any doubts.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I asked him about his experience.</li>\n<li>I asked him about my feedback. He told me that I have good communication skills and open source experience.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It is going to be very chill and easy, just be confident(not over).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Interview Experience Digital Specialist Engineer - Infosys","description":"Interview Experience Digital Specialist Engineer - Infosys","date":"2022-05-16T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/dse_interview_experience_infosys","tags":["Interview Experience"]}}},"pageContext":{}},
