I must say that this was the smoothest interview process I have involved into so far. During the process, I had another offer and I discuss and requested the HR to expedite the process.</p>\n<h2>Applying</h2>\n<p>I reached out to the senior recruiter via cold email, attached my resume and profile I am interested in working at Atlan.</p>\n<p>Within a day, I received a reply “We are very excited to take your application forward. As the next steps, we’d like to schedule a quick 15 to 20-minute phone call to know you better.” from recruiter.</p>\n<h2>First Call</h2>\n<p>The first call is basically a telephonic round with HR. We discuss about the role, company, my availability and further process.</p>\n<p>After this call, I was about to receive a challenge as a take home assignment.</p>\n<h2>The Challenge</h2>\n<p>The assignment comprised of a notion link describing the project overview, what to be done, what not to worry about.</p>\n<p>As the position I applied was frontend role, I received the challenge purely based on building the frontend web application.</p>\n<p>The submission requires a GitHub repo. The GitHub repo needs to consist the readme describing the problem and the solution, setup guide, performance analytics and tech stack used.</p>\n<p>The challenge deadline was 7 days, I submitted the challenge in the 2nd day along with documentation.</p>\n<p>I submitted the challenge on friday, I receive an update on monday, saying “We liked your solution”. After that, I had my technical interview next day(Tuesday).</p>\n<h2>Technical Interview</h2>\n<p>It was an hour long interview with the engineering director at Atlan. He made me comfortable and we had a great chat around the assignment.</p>\n<p>We started with discussion about Atlan, what problem Atlan is trying to solve, what do we do.</p>\n<p>After that I was about to demonstrate my solution(web-app) sharing my screen. We majorly discuss the edge cases, performance optimization, and what could I have done better.</p>\n<p>We also discuss regarding my familiarity with different tech stack and new technologies.</p>\n<p>I had no idea where the hour flies, and we ended the call.</p>\n<p>I was nervous as I could have done better in some optimization questions which I realized afterwards.</p>\n<h2>The Next Day(Offer Day)</h2>\n<p>I had interview on tuesday, it was wednesday(28th June). As I mention above, I had another offer from Fi(frontend intern), and need to join on 3rd July(onsite). It was risky moment as on wednesday I need to accept and arrange for my accomadations for fi and still I remain with cultural round at Atlan.</p>\n<p>I was more inclined to Atlan.</p>\n<p>I was about to send my acceptance to fi as I have not received update from Atlan, but just then I received call from HR that I cleared the technical interview and I had an offer. Luckily, I had no cultural round.</p>\n<p>I thank HR for being so generous and supportive throughout the process.</p>\n<h2>Timeline</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>15 June 2023: Reached out to recruiter.</li>\n<li>16 June 2023: Received reply for profile shortlisted.</li>\n<li>21 June 2023: Had a telephonic round with HR and received the challenge.</li>\n<li>23 June 2023: Submitted the assignment(Repo, Documentation, Deployed Link)</li>\n<li>26 June 2023: Received update and schedule for technical round.</li>\n<li>27 June 2023: Had a technical Round with Engineering Director.</li>\n<li>28 June 2023: Heard 4 Magical word “You have an offer”.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I had many rejections before the offer, more than 100 in span of a month. But each rejection, interview rejection led me to this final interview at Atlan. I must say that if I don’t have faced the rejection I could not have cleared the Atlan, even the challenge.</p>\n<p>At each rejection, I introspected myself and learned the thing in which I lagged. Offcourse, it was hard to receive rejections on rejections. But I am so grateful to have these rejections that made me strong and was able to clear the Atlan.</p>\n<p>Today I am starting my 2nd week at Atlan. And I had wonderful time on my first week at Atlan.</p>\n<p>Would like to thank my family and my friend Yashika Jotwani.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Atlan Interview Experience(Frontend Engineer Intern)","description":"This is the summary of my interview experience at Atlan for frontend engineer intern.","date":"2023-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/atlan_interview_experience","tags":["Interview Experience"]}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1481993802","1994492073","3391063840","604461682"]}
